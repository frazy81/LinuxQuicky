Runlevel
========

A linux system can operate in different Runlevels.

on [Debian](https://wiki.debian.org/RunLevel) these are:

* 0 (halt the system)
* 1 (single-user / minimal mode)
* 2-5 (multiuser/graphical modes)
* 6 (reboot the system)

if you want to go into single-user mode, type:

`init 1`

and

`init 5`

to come back to the graphical or multiuser interface.
